# C# Array Practice

This is my first C# console application.

The project contains a collection of small programs that practice working with arrays, such as:
- Merging arrays
- Copying elements from the end
- Finding different numbers
- Union and intersection of two arrays
- Checking if an array is ascending
- Sorting arrays
- Removing and inserting elements
- Rotating arrays

The goal of this project is learning and practicing core C# concepts like:
- Arrays
- Loops
- Methods
- User input handling
- Basic problem solving

This project represents my starting point in C# and will be improved in future projects.
